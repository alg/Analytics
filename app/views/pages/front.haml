        %em Welcome to Virginia Voter Log Analytics

      %p
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230; a new service for Virginia election officials.

      %p
        This service permits voter transactions to be uploaded, stored,
        consolidated, and analyzed, all while ensuring the privacy of
        individual voters.  Through analysis, we can improve voter services
        and increase voter participation, especially for those
        voters with systemic barriers to voting, like
        overseas and Military voters, and the disabled.
