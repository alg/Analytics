        %em Welcome to Virginia Voter Activity Analytics

      %p
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8230; a new service for Virginia election officials.

      %p
        This service permits voter transactions to be uploaded, stored,
        consolidated, and analyzed, all while ensuring the privacy of
        individual voters.  

      %p
        Through analysis, we can improve voter services
        and increase voter participation, especially for those
        voters with systemic barriers to voting, like
        overseas and Military voters, and the disabled.

            If you or your colleagues have already created an Election Log
            for a specific election, you can access the log to insert and
            manage the source data, and to run analytics on the consolidated
            log data to produce a variety of reports.

            If no Election Log is available that suits your purpose, you can
            create a new Election Log for a specific election and then select
            it to be used as your Existing Election Log.
