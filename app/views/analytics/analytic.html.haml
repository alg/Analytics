      With all the relevant data loaded, you can now run a variety of
      analytics over the consolidated set of data from all the logs that have
      been previously loaded.  (If you need to load some more data, go back to
      "2. Load Data") 

    %p
      In addition to a variety of reports that you can generate, you can also
      export a consolidated data set including all the log data, for
      publication or use with other data mining tools.  The data can be
      exported as‐is, or anonymized with all voter identifying data obscured.
