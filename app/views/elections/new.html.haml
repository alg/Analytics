          Your first step is to create an empty election log, using the name of
          the election, for example, 
          %em
            June 2012 Primary Election,
          and the election date.
        %p
          The start date for an electionâ€™s voter activity is typically the
          day after the previous election day.  The end date is typically the date
          when the election will certified, after which no further ballots will be
          counted.
