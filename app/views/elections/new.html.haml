      Your first step is to create an empty election log, using the name of
      the election, for example, 
      %em
        June 2012 Primary Election,
      and the election date.
    %p{:style=>"color:darkblue;"}
      The start date for an electionâ€™s voter activity is typically the
      day after the previous election day.  The end date is typically the date
      when the election will certified, after which no further ballots will be
      counted.
